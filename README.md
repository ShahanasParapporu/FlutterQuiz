This repository contains a Quiz Application built entirely in Flutter. The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in Flutter app development, making use of both Stateless and Stateful Widgets, reusable components, and third-party packages.

Key Concepts used:

1:Reusable Custom Components: The app includes a reusable custom button styled consistently across the UI.
2:Function Passing: Functions are passed between widgets for handling quiz logic dynamically.
3:State Management: Using initState() and stateful widgets, the app efficiently manages UI changes based on quiz progress.
4:Alignment, Padding, and Margins: Thoughtful layout design using Flutter's extensive positioning tools.
5:Maps and Data Iteration: Quiz data is stored in maps, which are iterated over with for loops and handled with type casting.
6:Scrollable Layout: The app includes a scrollable layout for a fluid user experience on various device sizes.
